# *Rooted*: My Personal Project

## What is *Rooted*?
**Rooted** is an application aimed to help people take care
of their houseplants.

## What does *Rooted* do?

**Rooted** allows users to:
- Add a plant to a list
  - add the plant's name
  - date the plant was purchased or received
  - add the type of plant
  - add plant growth requirements: sunlight, temperature
    humidity, soil type and water
- add where a given plant is located
- schedule dates of when plants were watered and need to be watered
- send reminders when plants need to be watered

## Who is *Rooted* for?
**Rooted** is made for people who love their houseplants
and want to see them grow. It is also for people who
love having plants in their house but struggle to keep them alive.

## Why this project is of interest to me.
This project is of interest to me because I am someone who
struggles to keep track of my houseplants and keep them thriving.
With a busy schedule it is easy to forget to water my plants.
