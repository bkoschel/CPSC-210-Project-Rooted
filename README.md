# *Rooted*: My Personal Project

## What is *Rooted*?
**Rooted** is an application aimed to help people take care
of their houseplants.

## What does *Rooted* do?

Keeping track of all of your plants is difficult!

**Rooted** allows users to:
- Add a plant to their plant collection
  - give their plant a name
  - add the type of plant (e.g. cactus or fern)
  - update how healthy their plant is
  - keep track of how often a plant needs to be watered
  - mark down if they watered their plant or not
- View all of your plants in one place, even if they are different rooms
- If your plants grow or start to die change their status


## Who is *Rooted* for?
**Rooted** is made for people who love their houseplants
and want to see them grow. It is also for people who
love having plants in their house but struggle to keep them alive.

## Why this project is of interest to me.
This project is of interest to me because I am someone who
struggles to keep track of my houseplants and keep them thriving.
With a busy schedule it is easy to forget to water my plants.
